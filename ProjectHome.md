Python wrapper for the EMC Atmos object storage platform.  Performs string signing, sends the HTTP requests, and parses the responses.

You currently need to get the wrapper code from SVN --- some aspects will change in the future including some of the data types returned by some methods.

New in [r72](https://code.google.com/p/atmos-python/source/detail?r=72):  wrapper now parses XML responses into Python objects.
